        <p class="para1">A front-end developer is a type of software developer who specializes in creating and designing
            the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. The primary
            responsibility of a front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or
            application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.</p>

        <h3 class="heading1">Q. How Front-End Developer Work?</h3>
        <p class="para2">Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including: <br>
            <br><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b> The standard markup language used to create the structure and
            layout of
            web pages. <br><br>
            <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> A stylesheet language used to control the presentation, formatting, and
            appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layout. <br><br>
            <b>JavaScript: </b> A programming language that allows developers to add interactivity, animations, and
            other
            dynamic elements to websites and web applications.

        <h1 class="heading2">Advanced JavaScript</h1>
        <h4 class="h4">Q. What is Advance JavaScript?</h4>
        <p class="para2"> Advanced JavaScript refers to the more complex and sophisticated features and techniques
            available in the
            JavaScript programming language. As one of the most popular programming languages for web development,
            JavaScript offers a wide range of capabilities that go beyond the basics. <br>
            JavaScript, a cornerstone of web development, has evolved significantly over the years. From its humble
            beginnings, it has transformed into a robust language with advanced features, commonly referred to as
            JavaScript Advanced.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">Q. Why we use Advanced JS in our code?</h4>
        <p class="para2">Advanced JavaScript concepts include closures, asynchronous programming with promises and
            async/await, as well as design patterns. They enhance code efficiency, scalability, and maintainability in
            complex web applications.</p>

        <div class="variable">
            <h3 class="topic">Variable Scoping:-</h3>
            <h3 class="heading3">var</h3>
            <p class="para2">The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It was introduced in the
                early days of the
                language and was the only way to declare variables for a long time. However, the "var" keyword has some
                limitations and has been largely replaced by the "let" and "const" keywords in modern JavaScript.

                One of the main issues with "var" is that it is function-scoped, rather than block-scoped. This means
                that variables declared with "var" are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared,
                rather than just within the block of code in which they appear. This can lead to unexpected behavior and
                can make it difficult to reason about the scope of variables in your code.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading3">let</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                The "let" keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) and is used to declare variables
                that can be reassigned later. "let" variables are block-scoped, which means that they are only
                accessible within the block of code in which they are declared. This makes them more predictable and
                easier to reason about than "var" variables.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading3">const</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                The "const" keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be
                reassigned later. "const" variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to "let" variables in
                that respect. However, the main difference is that "const" variables must be initialized with a value
                when they are declared and cannot be reassigned later.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="closure">
            <h3 class="topic">Closure:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
                surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
                function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is
                created, at function creation time.
            <div class="example">
                <u>Example:</u> <br>
                function myFunction() { <br>
                let a = 4; <br>
                return a * a;<br>
                }
            </div>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="literals">
            <h3 class="topic">Template Literals:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                Template literals, also known as template strings, are a feature in JavaScript that allow for easier
                string interpolation and multi-line strings. They are denoted by backticks (`) instead of single or
                double quotes.

            <div class="example">
                <u>Example:</u> <br>
                const name = "Alice"; <br>
                const message = `Hello, ${name}!`; <br>
                console.log(message); // Output: Hello, Alice!
            </div>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="destructuring">
            <h3 class="topic">Destructuring:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                The destructuring assignment is a cool feature that came along with ES6. Destructuring is a JavaScript
                expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into
                distinct variables. That is, we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.
            </p>

            <div class="example">
                <u>Example:</u> <br>
                let introduction = ["Hello", "I" , "am", "Sarah"]; <br>
                let greeting = introduction[0]; <br>
                let name = introduction[3]; <br>

                console.log(greeting);//"Hello" <br>
                console.log(name);//"Sarah"<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="defaultparameters">
            <h3 class="topic">Default Parameters:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                A default parameter is one that need not necessarily be provided by the caller; if it is missing, then a
                preestablished default value will be used instead.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <u>Example:</u> <br>
                function greet(name = "Guest") { <br>
                console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); <br>
                } <br>

                greet(); <br>

                // Output: Hello, Guest!
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="restparameters">
            <h3 class="topic">Rest Parameters:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array,
                providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <div class="example">
                <u>Example:</u> <br>
                function fun(a, b){ <br>
                return a + b; <br>
                } <br>
                console.log(fun(1, 2)); // 3 <br>
                console.log(fun(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // 3
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="SpreadOperator">
            <h3 class="topic">Spread Operator:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                The spread operator in JavaScript is a syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows you to spread
                the elements of an iterable (such as arrays, strings, or objects), into another iterable or function
                call.It is denoted by three dots “...” followed by an expression or an iterable. The spread operator is
                a powerful tool that provides a concise and flexible way to work with data in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <div class="example">

                const concatenatedArr = [...arr1, ...arr2]; <br>
                console.log(concatenatedArr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] <br>
                <br>
                <b class="bold">2. Spreading Strings</b> <br>

            <h3 class="topic">Shallow Copy:-</h3>
            <p class="para2">
                Shallow copy means that only the first level of the object is copied. Deeper levels are referenced.
                A shallow copy can be achieved using the spread operator (…) or using Object.assign().

                A module is a chunk of code in an external file that performs a specific task or function. It is a

                code into modules, developers can organize their programs more efficiently and make them easier to
                maintain. <br>
                1. JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. <br>
                2. This makes it easier to maintain a code-base. <br>
                3. Modules are imported from external files with the import statement. <br>
                4. Modules also rely on type="module" in the script tag.

            <p class="para2">
                Abstraction means hiding certain details that don't matter to the user and only showing essential
                features or functions.
                <br> <br>
                For example, take a cell phone. We don't show details like verifyTemperature(), verifyVolt(),
                frontCamOn(), frontCamOff() and so on. Instead we provide essential features which matter to user like
                camera(), volumeBtn(), and others.

            <p class="para2">
                Encapsulation means keeping properties and methods private inside a class, so that they are not
                accessible from outside that class. <br>
                This will keep code that's outside the class from accidentally manipulating internal methods and
                properties.

            <p class="para2">
                Inheritance makes all properties and methods available to a child class. This allows us to reuse common
                logic and to model real-world relationships. We will discuss inheritance in further section of this
                article with pratical example.

            <p class="para2">
                Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) that describes situations
                in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, polymorphism describes the
                concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide
                its own independent implementation of this interface.

                An API key is a unique code that identifies calls made to an API (Application Programming Interface). It
                is used to authenticate and/or authorize API users and to track their usage. In simpler terms, an API
                key is like a password that allows you to access certain data or services from an API. It is usually
                provided by the API provider upon registration

                The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests and processing the
                responses.Fetch is the modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest: unlike XMLHttpRequest, which uses
                callbacks, Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service
                workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).With the Fetch API, you make a request by calling
                fetch(), which is available as a global function in both window and worker contexts. You pass it a
                Request object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the
                request.The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response object representing
                the server's response. You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in
                various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.
            </p>

            <p class="example">

            <p class="para2">
                The then() method of Promise instances takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the fulfilled
                and rejected cases of the Promise. It stores the callbacks within the promise it is called on and
                immediately returns another Promise object, allowing you to chain calls to other promise methods.

                The catch() method of Promise instances schedules a function to be called when the promise is rejected.
                It immediately returns another Promise object, allowing you to chain calls to other promise methods. It
                is a shortcut for Promise.prototype.then(undefined, onRejected).

            <p class="para2">
                The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every
                HTML
                or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of
                HTML
                the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.

            <p class="para2">
                The primary purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration is to inform browsers about the version of the markup
                language in which the document is written. This helps browsers to render the document correctly by
                applying
                the appropriate parsing rules and rendering modes
